Thought process for the front-end:
-Since the hierarchy of the front-end in vue.js is a tree the main component will have 4 sections.
One section is a title, second is the header, third is content and fourth is the picker/result buttons
-The only parts that will change are title and content. The increment is a simple onclick function
-First, I am creating the general HTML/CSS and graphical layout
-Enable the button-press increment beside small pizza icon


-Now when the layout is done, start creating the home
-Transitions are left for the end

-Since Home is a child of App, we need to call the parent from a child. Unfortunately, nothing worked except:
this.$parent.$options.methods.methodName();
Alternative is to use mixins, but for the purpose of this assignment, I believe it is sufficient.

- v-if does not work for more than 2 if-then divs, so I need to use the css display trick.4
