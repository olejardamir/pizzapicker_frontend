Thought process for the front-end:
-Since the hierarchy of the front-end in vue.js is a tree the main component will have 4 sections.
One section is a title, second is the header, third is content and fourth is the picker/result buttons
-The only parts that will change are title and content. The increment is a simple onclick function
-First, I am creating the general HTML/CSS and graphical layout
-Enable the button-press increment beside small pizza icon


-Now when the layout is done, start creating the home
-Transitions are left for the end
